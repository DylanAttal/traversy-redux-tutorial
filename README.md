### Summary

This was my first time using Redux! I had previously used MobX as a state management library with React, but had yet to explore Redux. I decided to begin by following along with a tutorial step-by-step. The tutorial I followed was given by Brad Traversy through a YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93p3LxR9xfM.

Traversy began by explaining Redux to beginners. Then we built a basic React app that pulls dummy blog posts from the API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ which is a fake online REST API for testing and prototyping. Next, we built out the Redux boilerplate for our app. Finally, we made sure that the Chrome Redux Dev Tools worked with the app, and took a look at what our added data looked like through the Dev Tools.

### Project Goals

- [x] Learn how Redux manages state in React apps
- [x] Build out React app to show fake posts and allow user to add a new post title and post body
- [x] Build out Redux boilerplate
- [x] Ensure that Chrome Redux Dev Tools work for the app

### Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux
